## 🚨 Important Considerations

### Data Quality
- **Survivorship Bias**: Yahoo Finance may not include delisted stocks
- **Corporate Actions**: Splits and dividends are adjusted automatically
- **Data Gaps**: System handles missing data gracefully
- **Point-in-Time**: Be aware of look-ahead bias in feature construction

### Statistical Validity
- **Multiple Testing**: When testing thousands of features, expect false positives
- **Overfitting**: Always validate on out-of-sample data
- **Regime Changes**: Market conditions change; models may decay
- **Transaction Costs**: Not included in current analysis

### Performance Notes
- Start with fewer tickers and timeframes for initial testing
- GPU acceleration provides 5-10x speedup for large datasets
- Memory usage scales with number of tickers and features
- Database queries are optimized but can be slow for very large datasets
